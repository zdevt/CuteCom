I'd like to thank all developers who made improvements to
CuteCom within the past years. I have tried to scan all 
repos I could find for additions and improvements  useful 
for the reincarnation of this fine piece of software originally
created by Alexander Neundorf
I have not always copied the code directly but used the idea
behind. In case I might have used code originally written by
you but not mentioned you yet, please conctact me. I'll be more
than happy to add you to the list.

First of all the source of the original CuteCom
from Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org> which still
forms the base and large portions have been used for the
reimplemented CuteCom

Antoine Calando <acalando@free.fr>
https://github.com/calandoa/cutecom
Mainly the option for displaying control characters
like \n \r and \t
but also the idea of switching in- and output upside down

Damien R <damienrg@gmail.com>

Use QThread::msleep to delay characters

Luca Ottaviano <lottaviano@develer.com>
